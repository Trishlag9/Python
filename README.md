# Electric Vehicle Population Analysis

## Overview
This project analyzes Electric Vehicle (EV) population data to uncover trends and insights using Python. It covers data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), visualizations, and forecasting future EV registrations.

**1. Data Loading**

File: Electric_Vehicle_Population_Data.csv
Loaded using Pandas.

**2. Data Cleaning**

**3. EV Adoption Over Time**

EV adoption has been steadily increasing, with a significant surge in 2023.

**4. Top Counties by EV Registrations**

Seattle in King County leads EV registrations, followed by Bellevue and Redmond.

**5. Distribution of EV Types**

Clear distinctions in preferences for different EV types.

**6. Popularity of EV Manufacturers**

Tesla dominates EV registrations.

**7. Top Models in Leading Manufacturers**

Tesla Model Y and Model 3 are the most registered vehicles.

**8. Electric Range Analysis**

While many EVs offer high ranges, the average is skewed lower due to shorter-range vehicles.

**9. Average Electric Range by Model Year**

 Average range peaked in 2020 but has since declined slightly.
 
**10. EV Registrations Forecast**

Used scipy.optimize.curve_fit to model exponential growth.

Key Finding: The EV market is projected to grow exponentially.
